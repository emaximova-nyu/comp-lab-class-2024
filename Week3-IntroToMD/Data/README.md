* MD trajectory without water: (in .pdb format): 40 ps of NVT equilibration + 10 ns of NPT production MD, every 1000 frames
* MD log, containing all the temperature, density, volume, and potential energy values throughout the whole trajectory, every 100 frames

* Last frame from the MD trajectory for visualization
